schema.ts -> handle for when false error when trying to turn 
function string into JS function (.refine)

DoS dependabot thing

shit slow llm

prompt engineering lol 

dont be like akash and accidently send api key in github

better parsing look for a library or something




HERE WHAT I DID:

what i did rn for sse, it works just issues and its rough:
so basically we hit backend /start it makes outline and first step and sends it to frontend
also creates a session in memory, which has id, prompt, outline, what step we on, previous step for context for the llm whatever
and session also has 'subscribers' rn its empty

so after it does the first step then frontend hits the backend /stream with session id, and then it adds my frontend as a subscriber
and then it starts the sessionRunner which gets session info using the id i passed through, it sees the outline, what step its on, prev step and sends it
to generate the next step and then it broadcasts it, a fancy way of saying it fucking just writes it through the stream to the subscriber (frontend)

then theres lots of error handling, when its done delete session delete subscriber
just understand all ts make sure it makes sense cuz its rough rn

Yo Saf here r some issues might be more:

QUICK SUMMARY
1. instead of prev step make it objects in scene condensed
2. session ttl (if we create a session and leave rly quick then it hangs in memory)
3. llm shit it gives malformed shit sometimes


like okay say step1 it creates a point p1 and a line f1, step2 it updates the line f1, step3 it was only given prev step so maybe it tries to create a point
again and uses p1 since it only thinks f1 exists, then it fucks up. probably gotta send it like a whole list of objects and update parameters
so like on first request objects = null
then objects = p1, (1, 2, 3), f1, (x^2)
then we updated f1 so for step 3 we send it
p1, (1,2,3), f1, (x^3) or some shit yk so it knows all objects not just from last step
so yeah see how we can store and send an updated objects summary list after every step 

and maybe proper cleanup make sure sessions get deleted after just no huge errors blablabla ADD TIME TO LIVE -> basically if u exit the app quickly after making the prompt session reated but sse never started

also yk maybe fuck around with the prompt if u want to get it faster after the whole sse is done and fuck around with diff models

ALSO something important maybe if a step fails like it cant be parsed sometimes the model puts a bad format
we can just easy regenerate that step maybe add a fallback

also fucking look into like how we can make sure the math is right at the very end maybe a math model idk
