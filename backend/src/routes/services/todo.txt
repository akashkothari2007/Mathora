HERE WHAT I DID:

what i did rn for sse, it works just issues and its rough:
so basically we hit backend /start it makes outline and first step and sends it to frontend
also creates a session in memory, which has id, prompt, outline, what step we on, previous step for context for the llm whatever
and session also has 'subscribers' rn its empty

so after it does the first step then frontend hits the backend /stream with session id, and then it adds my frontend as a subscriber
and then it starts the sessionRunner which gets session info using the id i passed through, it sees the outline, what step its on, prev step and sends it
to generate the next step and then it broadcasts it, a fancy way of saying it fucking just writes it through the stream to the subscriber (frontend)

then theres lots of error handling, when its done delete session delete subscriber
just understand all ts make sure it makes sense cuz its rough rn

Yo Saf here r some issues might be more:



QUICK SUMMARY

1. also yk maybe fuck around with the prompt if u want to get it faster after the whole sse is done and fuck around with diff models
2. also fucking look into like how we can make sure the math is right at the very end maybe a math model idk
