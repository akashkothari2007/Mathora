# Mathora

> An AI-powered interactive calculus visualization tool that transforms mathematical concepts into dynamic, animated learning experiences.

## Vision

Mathora gives AI models a new superpower: the ability to create rich, animated visualizations to teach students mathematical concepts. Instead of static graphs or simple explanations, AI can now generate complex animation timelines that show functions morphing, integrals being calculated, and concepts coming to life through smooth, professional animations.

The goal is to enhance student learning by making abstract mathematical concepts tangible and intuitive through visual storytelling, powered by AI's understanding of both mathematics and pedagogy.

## Features

### Function Rendering & Animation
- **Real-time graphing** of mathematical functions using Three.js
- **Smooth curve rendering** with high-resolution point sampling
- **Animated transitions** - functions can morph to new equations with customizable duration
- **Dynamic domain changes** - animate `xmin` and `xmax` in real-time
- **Flicker-free updates** through intelligent interpolation

### Visual Integrals & Shading
- **Accurate region shading** between functions `f(x)` and `g(x)` or above/below the x-axis
- **Dynamic triangulated mesh** that updates as functions change
- **Smooth morphing** of shaded areas during function transitions
- **Stable geometry** with incremental interpolation for seamless animations

### Timeline-Based Animation System
- **Complex animation sequences** with precise timing control
- **Add, update, remove, and wait actions** for building rich narratives
- **Subtitle system** for synchronized explanations
- **Sequential and parallel animations** support

### AI-Powered Timeline Generation
- **Natural language input** - describe what you want to visualize in plain English
- **LLM-backed backend** generates complete animation timelines from prompts
- **Structured JSON output** following strict TypeScript schemas
- **Example**: "Show me how the integral of sin(x) changes as we shift it vertically"

### Professional UI
- **Custom axes and grid** with labeled tick marks
- **High-visibility design** optimized for educational use
- **Infinite grid plane** with fade distance for depth perception
- **Clean, modern interface** built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Google Gemini API Key** (get one at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MathGPT
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server** (from `backend/` directory)
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Start the frontend** (from `frontend/` directory)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start visualizing!

## 📖 Usage

1. **Enter a mathematical prompt** on the landing screen
   - Example: "Show me the area between sin(x) and 0.3cos(x) from -π to π"
   - Example: "Graph y = x² and animate it shifting up by 2 units"

2. **Watch the AI generate** a complete animation timeline

3. **Observe the visualization** as functions animate, regions shade, and concepts come to life

4. **Use the controls** to toggle graph, whiteboard, and explanation panels
