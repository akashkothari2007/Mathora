stuff i needa add
1. add lines to backend schema DONE
2. FIX THE GODDAMN TIMING SOMEHOW
3. MAYBE ADD A FIELD IN THE PLANNER OF WHAT TYPE OF GRID, (2d graph, unit circle, no axes)
SOMETHING COOL would be interaction, question steps, multiple choice. draws graph, asks where do they intersect
4. create templates (triangle?)
5. wire templates frontend+backend (ids!!!)
